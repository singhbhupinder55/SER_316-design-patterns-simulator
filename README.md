# Design Patterns Simulator

This repository contains the basic setup for the **Design Patterns Simulator** project, created as part of the SER316 coursework at Arizona State University. The project aims to implement and demonstrate various design patterns in Java.

## Current Setup
The following components are included in this submission:
- **Basic Program**: A simple program that outputs "Hello, Silicon Valley Simulator!" as a placeholder for future functionality.
- **Gradle Build System**: The project uses Gradle for building and dependency management.
- **Static Analysis Tools**:
  - **Checkstyle**: Ensures consistent code style and quality.
  - **SpotBugs**: Identifies potential bugs in the code.
- **Testing Framework**: JUnit is included, and a basic test case is implemented.
- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous integration is set up to ensure the project builds and tests successfully with every commit.

## Planned Design Patterns
This project will implement several design patterns, including but not limited to:
1. **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
2. **Factory**: Simplifies object creation by abstracting the instantiation process.
3. **Observer**: Establishes a one-to-many dependency where multiple objects are notified of changes in one object.
4. **Strategy**: Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms, allowing dynamic behavior changes at runtime.

## How to Build and Run
To work with this project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd ser316-DesignPatternsSimulator
